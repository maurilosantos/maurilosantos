â›µ I worked and studied at Escola Naval, a Brazilian Navy Academy. I sailed a lot around Brazil and really enjoyed life at sea, but my passion and enthusiasm for technology and programming made me follow this journey of being a Software Engineer.
<br>ðŸ˜Ž Today I share my projects as a student and I grow more and more in knowledge.<br>
ðŸ¤© I love making friends so chat with me!
